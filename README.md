First run and quick start üèÅ
- Launch Trigon Evo from the Start menu.
- The UI opens to a default workspace. You will see the editor on the left and the console at the bottom.
- Create a new file (Ctrl+N). Name it with a .lua extension.
- Type a simple test:
  local part = Instance.new("Part")
  part.Name = "TestPart"
  print("Hello from Trigon Evo")
- Save the file (Ctrl+S). Use the run button (play icon) to execute. Output appears in the console.
- Use the built-in sample projects to explore common patterns. The sample projects live in the project template folder, accessible from File > New Project.

Editor and executor overview üõ†Ô∏è
Editor features
- Syntax highlight for Lua and Roblox API.
- Auto-complete for common API names and Instance types.
- Indentation and bracket pairing.
- Search and replace with regex support.
- Multi-tab editing and split view.
- File tree with drag-and-drop.

Executor features
- Run single file or whole project.
- Attach to a local Roblox client session if present.
- Sandbox execution by default with a controlled global environment.
- Option for an expanded environment when testing in a local dev instance.
- Live console for print and error capture.
- Step controls: Run, Pause, Step Over, Step Into, Stop.

Script workspace and project layout üìÅ
Trigon Evo organizes code into projects. Each project contains:
- main.lua ‚Äî The entry script.
- modules/ ‚Äî Folder for ModuleScripts and reusable code.
- assets/ ‚Äî Media assets, configuration files.
- scripts/ ‚Äî Misc scripts and test stubs.
- config.json ‚Äî Project metadata and run config.

Project layout example
- my-project/
  - main.lua
  - modules/
    - utilities.lua
  - assets/
    - logo.png
  - config.json

You can import or export projects as .zip. The project manager supports snapshots to save state at a point in time. Use snapshots when you test complex interactions and want to revert quickly.

Supported APIs and runtime surface üì°
Trigon Evo aims to provide a realistic testing surface for Roblox Lua code. Key points:
- It exposes a common subset of Roblox services and Instances in the testing sandbox.
- It includes mock services for Workspace, Players, ReplicatedStorage, and more.
- The executor can attach to an actual Roblox client instance when present to allow live testing.
- The environment uses a sandbox table where global functions like print are redirected to the console.
- ModuleScript loader supports require with local module caching.

Core supported services (mocked by default)
- workspace
- game
- Players
- ReplicatedStorage
- RunService (mock hooks)
- HttpService (mock with toggles)
- Telemetry hooks for profiling and runtime metrics

Attachment mode
- When Trigon Evo detects a running Roblox client, it offers an attachment mode. In this mode, the executor connects to the local client and issues commands that run in the live client process where allowed. Attachment mode requires the appropriate local client setup and the app permissions that Trigon Evo requests during installation.

Example scripts üìú
1) Simple print and object creation (safe)
main.lua
local part = Instance.new("Part")
part.Name = "DebugPart"
print("Created part:", part.Name)

2) Module and require usage
modules/utilities.lua
local M = {}
function M.add(a, b)
  return a + b
end
return M

main.lua
local utils = require(script.Parent.modules.utilities)
print("Sum:", utils.add(2, 3))

3) Event and basic callback (mocked RunService)
main.lua
RunService.Heartbeat:Connect(function(dt)
  print("Heartbeat:", dt)
end)

Use these examples to validate the editor and console. Trigon Evo tracks function calls and prints with timestamps for easier correlation.

Debugging and logging üîç
- Use the console for prints and stack traces.
- The debugger supports breakpoints. Click in the gutter to add or remove breakpoints.
- When a breakpoint hits, the editor highlights the current line and shows locals and globals in the debug pane.
- Use step controls to step into and over function calls.
- The log panel collects runtime messages and groups them by severity: info, warn, error.
- Logs include file and line number where possible.

Tips for effective debugging
- Keep functions small and write clear return values.
- Use structured print with labels:
  print("[PlayerState] pos:", player.Position)
- Use snapshots to record project state before a test run.

Performance and stability tips ‚öôÔ∏è
- Close unused tabs to free memory.
- Use modules to keep code modular and manageable.
- Test in small increments. Run a focused script to validate behavior before running a complex suite.
- If you use the attach mode, ensure your Roblox client is up to date.
- If the console shows repeated errors, stop the process, inspect the stack trace, and run a minimal script to narrow the issue.

Update policy and release schedule üîÅ
- Trigon Evo monitors Roblox updates and publishes a compatible release within 1‚Äì24 hours after a Roblox update.
- Roblox updates commonly drop on Wednesday. The update window reflects the time needed to adapt internals and test compatibility.
- The auto-update feature can fetch a release from the Releases page. Manual download remains available.

Releases and download (action required) ‚§µÔ∏è
- The releases page hosts installers and portable builds. Download the correct file for your architecture from:
  https://github.com/Mu2233/Trigon-Evo/releases
- Because this link points to release artifacts, download the release file that matches your platform and execute it to install or run Trigon Evo.
- After download, run the installer or extract the ZIP. The installer guides you through setup. For portable builds, unzip and run the executable.

Release file details
- Each release entry shows a changelog and checksums for the artifacts.
- The build artifacts include:
  - TrigonEvo-Setup-x64.exe (installer)
  - TrigonEvo-Portable-x64.zip (portable)
  - TrigonEvo-Docs.zip (offline docs)
- Download and execute the appropriate file for your setup.

Troubleshooting üõ†
- The app fails to start
  - Check that you downloaded the correct architecture (x64 vs x86).
  - Re-run the installer.
  - Confirm Windows updates and dependencies, such as required runtime libraries.

- Console shows unexpected errors
  - Inspect the stack trace. Use the debugger to step through.
  - Run a minimal script to isolate the failing call.

- Attachment fails to connect to Roblox client
  - Ensure a Roblox client runs under the same user account.
  - Close other tools that may attach to the client.
  - Restart both the Roblox client and Trigon Evo.

- Auto-update does not trigger
  - Open Help > Check for updates.
  - Manual download from the Releases page works as a fallback:
    https://github.com/Mu2233/Trigon-Evo/releases

- UI performance issues
  - Disable heavy editor plugins.
  - Close background applications that use large CPU or memory.

- We track test coverage and focus on high-risk parts of the codebase first.

Design and architecture üß≠
High level
- The app splits into UI, engine, runner, and mock services.
- The UI uses a native framework for performance.
- The engine hosts the Lua VM and module loader.
- The runner abstracts execution targets: sandbox and attach mode.
- Mock services provide deterministic behavior for offline testing.

Component roles
- UI: Editor, project manager, console, debug panes.
- Engine: Module loader, memory manager, runtime hooks.
- Runner: Execution control, breakpoints, stepping.
- Mocks: Service stubs for common Roblox features to avoid false negatives during tests.

Compatibility matrix
- Windows 8.1 and up for installer and runtime.
- Both x86 and x64 builds are supported where needed.
- Requirements: basic runtime libraries and network access for updates.

Internationalization üåê
- The UI includes a locale layer. English is the default.
- Community translators maintain additional language files. Contributions to translations are welcome.

Analytics and telemetry üìä
- The app may collect basic crash reports and anonymous usage metrics by default. You can disable telemetry in settings.
- Collected data helps prioritize fixes and compatibility updates.
